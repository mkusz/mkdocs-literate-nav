MkDocs doesn't actually support that, and neither is it representable in YAML directly, so the plugin tries to do the next best thing: include the link as the first page of the section. However, this structure is perfectly suited for the section-index plugin, which actually makes this work. Or you could just not associate a link with sections: To get this navigation, create the file SUMMARY.md : (old YAML equivalent:) Frob Baz Borgs Bar Foo * [ Frob ]( index.md ) * [ Baz ]( baz.md ) * Borgs * [ Bar ]( borgs/bar.md ) * [ Foo ]( borgs/foo.md ) nav : - Frob : index.md - Baz : baz.md - Borgs : - Bar : borgs/bar.md - Foo : borgs/foo.md Nav cross-link # But why stop there?

Just drop the file borgs/SUMMARY.md and let it be inferred. The fallback behavior follows the default behavior of MkDocs when nav isn't specified , except that you can opt out on a per-directory basis. Is your directory structure not so tidy? That's not a problem, the implicit nav will not add duplicates of pages already mentioned elsewhere (but you can always add duplicates explicitly...) nav_file # We've been using SUMMARY.md as the name of the file that specifies the nav, but naturally, you can use any other file name. The plugin takes care to not let MkDocs complain if you don't end up using the nav document as an actual page of your doc site. Or maybe you want the opposite -- make the nav page very prominent? You can actually use the index page, README.md , for the nav (and that's even the default)! Why would one do this? Well, GitHub (or another source hosting) also displays the Markdown files, and it's quite a nice perk to show off your navigation right in the index page of a directory. What's that, you ask? If the index page is taken up by navigation, we can't put any other content there, can we? Actually, we can! The nav list can just be put at the bottom of the page that also has whatever other content before that.
